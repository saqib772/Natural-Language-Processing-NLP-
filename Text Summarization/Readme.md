# Text Summarization 

This is a simple Python script that uses NLTK library to summarize a given text. It works by tokenizing sentences, removing stop words, calculating word and sentence frequencies, and selecting the top sentences based on their scores.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. NLTK library

# Installation
To install NLTK library, run the following command:

``` pip install nltk ```

To download the stopwords data, run the following command in Python shell:

nltk.download('stopwords')

# Usage
To run the script, save it as text_summarizer.py and execute it with Python:

``` python text_summarizer.py ```

The script will print out the summary of the sample text provided in the code. You can change the sample text to any text you want by editing the text variable in the code.
